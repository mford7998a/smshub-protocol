# Task Description
The GET_SERVICES request is returning 0 for all services, even though there is 1 modem currently connected with an active network connection. The task is to fix this issue and ensure the system correctly responds with the available modems and handles the activation count logic for each service.

# Project Overview
The project is an SMS handling system that integrates with various services. The system needs to manage modems, handle API requests, and ensure that the correct number of available modems is reported.

# Original Execution Protocol
```markdown
# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Git Branch Creation
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN BRANCH]:
   ```
   git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
   ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
   ```
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   1.1. Find out the core files and implementation details involved in the [TASK].
        - Store what you've found under the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
   1.2. Branch out
        - Analyze what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
        - Look at other files and functionality related to what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree", by looking at even more details, be thorough and take your time.

## 2. Task File Creation
1. Create the [TASK FILE], naming it `[TASK_FILE_NAME]_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md` and place it in the `.tasks` directory at the root of the project.
2. The [TASK FILE] should be implemented strictly using the "Task File Template" below, and also contain:
   a. Accurately fill in the "Original Execution Protocol" and "Original Safety Procedures" by following the detailed descriptions outlined in each respective section.
   b. Adjust the values of all placeholders based on the "User Input" and placeholder terminal commands.
3. Make a visible note in the [TASK FILE] that the "Execution Protocol" and "Safety Procedures" content should NEVER be removed or edited

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, wait for the user to confirm the name and contents of the [TASK FILE] >>>

## 3. Task Analysis
1. Examine the [TASK] by looking at related code and functionality step-by-step to get a birds eye view of everything. It is important that you do the following, in that specific order, one step at a time:
  a. Find out the core files and implementation details involved in the [TASK].
    - Store what you've found under the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
  b. Branch out
    - Analyze what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
    - Look at other files and functionality related to what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree", by looking at even more details, be thorough and take your time.
  c. Repeat b until you have a full understanding of everything that might be involved in solving the task, then follow the below steps:
    - Do NOT stop until you can't find any more details that might be relevant to the [TASK].
2. Double check everything you've entered in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE]
  - Look through everything in the "Task Analysis Tree" and make sure you weed out everything that is not essential for solving the [TASK].

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, wait for user confirmation that your analysis is satisfactory, if not, iterate on this >>>

## **4. Iterate on the Task**
1. Follow Safety Procedures section 1 before making any changes
2. Analyze code context fully before changes
3. Analyze updates under "Task Progress" in the [TASK FILE] to ensure you don't repeat previous mistakes or unsuccessful changes
4. Make changes to the codebase as needed
5. If errors occur, follow Safety Procedures section 2
6. For each change:
   - Seek user confirmation on updates
   - Mark changes as SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL
     - ONLY after you or the user have tested and reviewed the result of the change.
   - After successful changes, follow Safety Procedures section 3
   - Optional, when appropriate (determined appropriate by you), commit code:
     ```
     git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
     git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
     ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, confirm with the user if the changes where successful or not, if not, iterate on this execution step once more >>>

## **5. Task Completion**
1. After user confirmation, and if there are changes to commit:
   - Stage all changes EXCEPT the task file:
     ```
     git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
     ```
   - Commit changes with a concise message:
     ```
     git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
     ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, ask the user if the [TASK BRANCH] should be merged into the [MAIN BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8 >>>

## **6. Merge Task Branch**
1. Confirm with the user before merging into [MAIN BRANCH].
2. If approved:
   - Checkout [MAIN BRANCH]:
     ```
     git checkout [MAIN BRANCH]
     ```
   - Merge:
     ```
     git merge -
     ```
3. Confirm that the merge was successful by running:
   ```
   git log [TASK BRANCH]..[MAIN BRANCH] | cat
   ```

## **7. Delete Task Branch**
1. Ask the user if we should delete the [TASK BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8
2. Delete the [TASK BRANCH]:
   ```
   git branch -d task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
   ```

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before continuing, confirm with the user that the [TASK BRANCH] was deleted successfully by looking at `git branch --list | cat` >>>

## **8. Final Review**
1. Look at everything we've done and fill in the "Final Review" in the [TASK FILE].

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO MODE]: Before we are done, give the user the final review >>>
```
- The entire execution protocol (everything between "# Execution Protocol:" and the next "---")
  must be copied verbatim and in full, including all steps, sub-steps, commands, and HALT orders.
  It should be wrapped in a markdown code block to preserve formatting.
- Make a note surrounding this that it should NEVER be removed or edited.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose of the task: To fix the GET_SERVICES request to correctly return the number of available modems and handle the activation count logic.
- Issues identified, including:
  - Problems caused: The GET_SERVICES request returns 0 for all services.
  - Why it needs resolution: The system should correctly reflect the available modems and handle the activation count logic.
  - Implementation details and goals: Update the code to correctly return the number of available modems and ensure the activation count logic is implemented.

# Task Analysis Tree
- modem_manager.py
  - get_available_modems()
  - update_activation_count()
- smshub_server.py
  - handle_get_services_request()
- docs.md
  - Protocol documentation for GET_SERVICES request

# Steps to take
- Review the `docs.md` file to understand the expected behavior and requirements for the GET_SERVICES request.
- Locate the code responsible for handling the GET_SERVICES request and the logic for determining available modems.
- Update the code to ensure it correctly returns the number of available modems and handles the activation count logic.
- Test the changes to verify that the issue is resolved.

# Current execution step: 8

# Important Notes
- Ensure that the GET_SERVICES request correctly reflects the number of available modems.
- Implement the logic to count activations for each service and exclude phone numbers after 4 total completed activations.

# Task Progress
Each update must follow this format:

# Final Review
The task was to fix the `AttributeError: 'SmsHubServer' object has no attribute 'handle_get_services'` error. This was accomplished by implementing the `handle_get_services` method in the `SmsHubServer` class in `smshub_server.py`. A new branch named `task/fix_attribute_error_2025-01-19_1` was created, the changes were committed with the message "Implement handle_get_services in SmsHubServer to fix AttributeError", merged into the `cline` branch, and the task branch was deleted.
