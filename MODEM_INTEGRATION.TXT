To integrate another model of modem into this application, you would need to make several changes, primarily in the ModemManager class. Here's a step-by-step guide on what needs to be done and considerations to ensure it doesn't interfere with the current setup:
Identify the New Modem's Characteristics:
Determine the new modem's Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), and any unique identifiers in its description.
Modify the Modem Detection Logic:
Update the _scan_modems method in modem_manager.py to include the new modem's VID, PID, and description in the filtering logic. This is where the application currently identifies Qualcomm devices.
3. Adjust Initialization Commands:
If the new modem requires different AT commands for initialization, modify the _add_modem method to include these commands. Ensure that the commands are compatible with the new modem's firmware.
Update Modem Information Parsing:
If the new modem provides information in a different format, update the parsing logic in methods like _parse_imei_response, _parse_ccid_response, and others to correctly interpret the responses.
Testing:
Add or update unit tests in tests/test_modem_management.py to cover the new modem's detection and initialization. This ensures that the integration does not break existing functionality.
GUI Adjustments:
If the new modem has specific features or statuses that need to be displayed, update the ModemGUI class to handle these appropriately.
Considerations to Avoid Interference:
Backward Compatibility: Ensure that any changes made for the new modem do not remove or alter the existing logic for the current modems. This can be achieved by adding conditions specific to the new modem without affecting the existing ones.
Testing: Thoroughly test the application with both the existing and new modems to ensure that the changes do not introduce any regressions.
Configuration: Consider making the modem detection logic configurable, allowing for easy addition of new modems without modifying the codebase. This could involve using a configuration file or database to store modem-specific parameters
